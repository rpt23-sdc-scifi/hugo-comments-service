## Overview:

For Hack Reactor's culminating Systems Design Capstone project, focused on databases and production deployment and optimization, students are asked to create 10 million mock primary records (i.e. songs).

This comments service, which generates between 0 and 10 comments per song, stores up to 100 million records. A seeding script to generate this mock data is provided.

#

## Setup:

1. Clone this repo and go to its root directory.
1. Run `npm install` to install its dependencies.
1. Seed the database with `npm run seed`.
1. Run `npm run build` to build the browser components.
1. After building the components, run `npm run sever` to start the application in development mode.
1. Access the app at **localhost:4000/{song_id}** where **{song_id}** is the Song ID. A list of comments by song is displayed.
